# CHECKMATE
CHECKMATE is a visual novel game that was made as a university project. Our team consisted of 2 people. The two of us developed the game story & concept together. I was mainly responsible for game development and the other person for game art. 
You can play the 2nd demo version here: [Checkmate 2.0](https://katori1210.itch.io/checkmate20-beta)

In CHECKMATE, player steps into the role of a detective in a fictional, multicultural underground world inspired by real-life Mafia activities. Use your decisions to gather clues and solve a murder case, ultimatly uncovering the true mastermind behind the crime. Developed in Ren'Py for PC, navigate the story using simple mouse clicks and the spacebar.

Besides selecting different decisions as the main gameplay, we also had the inventory feature in the game for collecting items and interacting with them.

For this game version we thought it would be fun to have a mini-game while player is processing through the story. That's why a small crossword puzzle with tricky questions was implemented
